# Boids Simulation with OpenGL

A simple Boids simulation implemented in OpenGL, using GLFW and ImGui for configuration.

</p>


## Features

- Real-time simulation of flocking behavior using the Boids algorithm.
- Interactive configuration using ImGui for adjusting parameters.
- Rendering of individual Boids as simple shapes.
- **TODO: Move simulation calculations to shaders to improve performance.**
- **TODO: Refactor the application into an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure.**
- **TODO: Implement a cube that can be moved for the Boids to follow.**
- **TODO: Implement obstacle avoidance.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- G++ compiler
- Modern OpenGL
- GLFW3

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gsoaresbaptista/opengl-boids
cd opengl-boids
```

2. Compile the code using the provided Makefile:
```shell
make
```

3. Run the simulation:
```shell
./boids
```

## Usage

1.  Launch the simulation executable.
2.  Use the ImGui interface to adjust parameters like flocking behavior, boid perception radius, etc.
