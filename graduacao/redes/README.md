# Network-Pinger

## About

A UDP client and server pinger to the computer engineering course of Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil.
This is a very simple implementation of a pinger, using UDP although ICMP is ideal for this type of application, once the main goal is learning.
The client can save all sent and received packet data to a csv file, while the server and the client can save the stdout output to a txt logger file. Default timeout is 10 seconds for both server and client.

## Running

Make sure you have ```Python 3.10.6``` or a more recent version and be in the root folder.

First, install all dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To run the server, do:

```python pinger/server_cli.py```

For the client, run:

```python pinger/client_cli.py```

Some parameters can be passed to  both cli, to see more about this add ```--help``` to the end of either command.


## Simulations

The server can simulate a few possible fauls, such as:
- Delayed response: Wait min **10ms** and max **200ms** to send the response
- Packet loss: Response packet is not sent to client with **25%** chance
- Packet protocol errors: Add a protocol error to packet with **25%** chance. Could be, invalid ping/pong, non-numeric timestamp and different messages


The client handles the failures simulated by the server, considering them when calculating the statistics. All simulations must be enabled if desired as they are disabled by default.

## Server Parameters

Some parameters can be passed to the server cli to change certain behaviors. Are they:
- ```-ip``` or ```--server_ip```: Defines the ip address that the server will be hosted. (Default: 127.0.0.1)
- ```-port``` or ```--server_port```: Defines the port that the server will be hosted. (Default: 3000)
- ```-l``` or ```--logger```: The server saves all stdout output in the server_log.txt file.
- ```-t NUMBER``` or ```--timeout NUMBER```: The server stops after **NUMBER** seconds with no requests.
- ```-sd``` or ```--simulate_delay```: The server allows packet delay response simulation.
- ```-sl``` or ```--simulate_loss```: The server allows packet loss simulation.
- ```-sp``` or ```--simulate_protocol_error```: The server allows packet protocol errors simulation.


An example to run a server cli with parameters is:

```python pinger/server_cli.py -t 2 -sd -sl -sp```

Server running with a timeout of 2 seconds and simulating delay and loss.


## Client Parameters

The client can receive parameters below by command line:
- ```-ip``` or ```--server_ip```: Defines the IP address to which the client will connect. (Default: 127.0.0.1)
- ```-port``` or ```--server_port```: Defines the port the server will connect to. (Default: 3000)
- ```-l``` or ```--logger```: The client saves all stdout output in the client_log.txt file.
- ```-t NUMBER``` or ```--timeout NUMBER```: The client will consider the packet lost after waiting for **NUMBER** seconds.
- ```-c``` or ```--csv```: The client saves all sent and received packet data in the packets_data.csv file.
-  ```-p NUMBER``` or ```--packets NUMBER```: The client will send **NUMBER** packets to the server.

An example to run a client cli with parameters is:

```python pinger/client_cli.py --timeout 1 --csv --packets 10```

## Example

Running the following commands in separate terminals:

```python pinger/server_cli.py -t 3 -sd -sl -sp -l```

```python pinger/client_cli.py --packets 5 --timeout 1 --csv --logger```

We got the following output files:
